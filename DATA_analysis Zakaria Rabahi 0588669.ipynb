    "# Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis for Gokart Rentals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the gokart rental dataset. The primary goal is to uncover patterns and relationships between various weather conditions and gokart rental counts. By leveraging multiple techniques such as visualizations, correlation matrices, box plots, and scatter plots, we aim to gain valuable insights into the factors influencing gokart rentals. These insights will guide further analysis and model building efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any data science project. It involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset and visualizing important aspects to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. EDA helps to understand the data better and lays the groundwork for building robust predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step is detailed with descriptions, code, visualizations, and insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type of Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are addressing is predicting gokart rental checkouts based on various features such as date, hour, temperature, wind, humidity, etc. This is a supervised learning problem because we have labeled data (i.e., we know the number of rentals for each set of features).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, this is a regression problem because the target variable (number of gokart rentals) is continuous rather than categorical. We aim to predict the actual rental count, not classify it into discrete categories.\n"

    "## Handling Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding with further analysis, it is crucial to handle any missing values in the dataset. Missing values can significantly impact the results of our analysis and the performance of machine learning models. We will check for missing values, visualize them, and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checking for Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - We start by checking the dataset for any missing values using the `isnull().sum()` method. This will give us a count of missing values for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visualizing Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - To get a better understanding of the distribution of missing values, we use a heatmap. This visualization helps us quickly identify columns and rows with missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Handling Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - There are several ways to handle missing values, including removing rows/columns with missing data or filling them with a specific value. In this case, we choose to fill the missing values with the mean of the respective column. This approach maintains the dataset's size and can be useful if the number of missing values is not excessively high.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verification**:\n",
    "   - After handling the missing values, we verify that there are no more missing values left in the dataset by checking the sum of missing values again.\n",
    "\n",
    "By handling missing values appropriately, we ensure that our subsequent analysis and modeling are not adversely affected by incomplete data.\n"
