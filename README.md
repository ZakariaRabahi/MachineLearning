## [Machine Learning Models](https://github.com/yourusername/MachineLearningModels)

This project involves the development and comparison of various machine learning models, including **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**, to solve a regression task. The project focuses on analyzing a dataset, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance using different techniques.

### Features:
- **Linear Regression Model**: Built a basic regression model to predict the target variable using linear relationships between the features.
- **Random Forest Model**: Implemented an ensemble learning method, using multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
- **XGBoost Model**: Developed an advanced boosting algorithm, focusing on speed and performance optimization.
- **Data Analysis**: Performed an in-depth exploratory data analysis to understand patterns, correlations, and feature importance in the dataset.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The core language used to implement the models and perform data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: All models and analyses were written and executed in Jupyter Notebook for interactive development and visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Utilized for building the Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
- **XGBoost Library**: Used to implement the XGBoost model.
- **Pandas & Matplotlib**: For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
